# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the central hub for OctoAcme's project management documentation. This README provides an overview of our project management approach and links to all process documents.

## Overview

OctoAcme follows a structured, iterative approach to project management that applies to all cross-functional projects delivering product features, services, or integrations. Our process is designed to keep teams aligned, customers first, and delivery predictable — from the first idea through to continuous improvement after release.

## Project Management Lifecycle

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Initiation** | Validate the business need, align stakeholders, define success criteria, and decide go/no-go for planning. |
| **Planning** | Turn an approved initiative into an actionable backlog, release plan, and milestone map. |
| **Execution & Tracking** | Manage day-to-day delivery, track progress, run standups, and keep the project board current. |
| **Risk & Communication** | Identify, assess, and mitigate risks; keep stakeholders informed through regular updates. |
| **Release & Deployment** | Standardize how features are released to production to reduce risk and improve observability. |
| **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement** | Capture learnings after each sprint or release and convert them into actionable improvements. |
| **Roles & Personas** | Understand the responsibilities of each team member throughout the project lifecycle. |

## Core Principles

OctoAcme project management is guided by the following principles:

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in every decision.
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments rather than big-bang releases.
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead accountable for outcomes.
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence.
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage open feedback, candid retrospectives, and continuous learning.

## Key Artifacts

Every project maintains the following core artifacts:

- **Project Charter / One-pager** — Problem statement, goals, success metrics, and stakeholders.
- **Roadmap and Release Plan** — Timeline, milestones, and release targets.
- **Sprint/Iteration Backlog** — Prioritized, estimated work items with acceptance criteria.
- **Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done** — Clear standards for what "done" means.
- **Risk Register** — Tracked risks with impact, likelihood, owner, and mitigation plan.
- **Retrospective Notes and Action Items** — Learnings and improvements from each sprint or milestone.

## Communication Cadence

| Cadence | Participants | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Daily standup (15 min) | Delivery team | Progress, blockers, dependencies |
| Weekly sync | PM + Product Manager | Alignment, risks, decisions |
| Twice-weekly standups | Delivery team (as agreed) | Detailed execution updates |
| Sprint demo / review | Team + stakeholders | Showcase progress and gather feedback |
| Monthly stakeholder update | PM + stakeholders | High-level status and roadmap review |
| Ad-hoc escalation | As needed | Business-impacting issues or blockers |
